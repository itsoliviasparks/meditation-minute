## About
Sometimes you just need to take a minute & have a breather. Never meditated before? Don't worry! All the heavy meditation lifting is done for you with this app.
Meditation Minute utilizes two APIs to fetch and display data in response to user interaction. This is a Paired Programing project between <a href="https://github.com/rselvasoyak">Rana Soyak</a> & <a href="https://github.com/itsoliviasparks">Olivia Sparks</a>.

## Features
- This project was created as an exercise in collecting user input, fetching data from APIs & manipulating the DOM with vanilla JavaScript
- We utilized 2 APIs, JavaScript, Sass, and HTML in the creation of this project
- The site features data pulled from the <a href="https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/">Rijks Museum API</a> & <a href="https://zenquotes.io">Zen Quotes API</a>
